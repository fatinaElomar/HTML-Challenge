            <h2><u>A Day In The Life</u></h2>
            Before we dive into a day in the life of a software developer, we should add two disclaimers:<br>
            Obviously, the job varies day-to-day. <br>
            Also, every company has its own culture and quirks. We’ll start with some context for project work.

                <li>A good developer is not only being a great programmer but also possessing great habits.</li><br>

                <li>Be physically active. </li><br>

            <h2>
                <b><u>Daily Routine of a Software Developer</u></b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                So your day might break down like this:<br>

                9 am: Come in, check emails, arrange short, medium and long-term to-do lists, organise meetings<br>

                10 am: Standup meeting, coordinate day and organise collaboration <q>if any</q><br>

                Then it’s into project work: Carry out coding, problem-solving and development.
                <br>At various points, you will ask for advice <q>or give advice</q>.
                <br> Depending on the environment,
                you
                might chat or send a message via Slack or IRC <q>a form of chat popular among software devs</q>.<br>
                If members of your team are free, you might go to a whiteboard together or sit together and then diagram
                and
                work out a solution. <q>Then you might possibly go back to struggling!</q>
                Depending on the company, after you find a solution, you’d usually create a “change request” or “pull
                request”<br> summarising changes proposed, which someone else would review.
                <br> They might have ideas or solutions of their own.

                This would probably bring you to lunch. Often, the afternoon is when meetings are held, and longer-term
                projects are discussed.
