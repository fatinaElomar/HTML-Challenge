<h3>A Day In The Life</h3>
Before we dive into a day in the life of a software developer, we should add two disclaimers:<br>
 Obviously, the job varies day-to-day. <br>
Also, every company has its own culture and quirks. We’ll start with some context for project work.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Daily Routine of a Software Developer
    </h4><p>
    So your day might break down like this:

9 am: Come in, check emails, arrange short, medium and long-term to-do lists, organise meetings

10 am: Standup meeting, coordinate day and organise collaboration <q>if any</q>

Then it’s into project work: Carry out coding, problem-solving and development.
<br>At various points, you will ask for advice <q>or give advice</q>.<br> Depending on the environment, you might chat or send a message via Slack or IRC <q>a form of chat popular among software devs</q>.<br>
 If members of your team are free, you might go to a whiteboard together or sit together and then diagram and work out a solution. <q>Then you might possibly go back to struggling!</q>

Depending on the company, after you find a solution, you’d usually create a “change request” or “pull request”<br> summarising changes proposed, which someone else would review.
<br> They might have ideas or solutions of their own.

This would probably bring you to lunch. Often, the afternoon is when meetings are held, and longer-term projects are discussed.
